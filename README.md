#Final Project:
##How much does the temperature is rising in New York?

#Descritption
This project is part of my thesis research around the topic of **Sea Level Rise**. The type of story I want to create is informative and educational, this is one of a group of infographics that presents relevant data around how the temperature is changing in our environment.

The final objective is to create a **tool** to communicate how drastic the weather is changing and the consequences of climate change.

##Project Procedure
At the beginning, when I was creating the style guide and choosing visualizations,  I wanted to create a whole website that guides you through the narrative by charts, maps, and connections between each other.  So, I divided this into three parts and I decided to start from general data about climate change: Heating temperature in New York.

For our thesis, we are currently working in Rockaways, a peninsula located in the southern part of Queens. Because of this, I chose 2 areas nearby this zone and one in Manhattan to compare:

**1.** Central Park

**2.** JFK, Queens (this is the area where Rockaway is located)

**3.** La Guardia, Queens


So this is the first step of a series of infographic that will build up the topic of sea level rise as consequence of climate change

**Note:** the final platform will use this template (which has some changes already):[Final idea] (https://andrecr.github.io/Final-Project-SLR/)   with the [charts](https://andrecr.github.io/Project-Layout/)and graphics that I have already started.
